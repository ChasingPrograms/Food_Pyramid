# Food_Pyramid

## @author -> Charles Jenno Buguina ##

## Version 1 ##
- index.html created with HTML
- Stylesheet is made with SASS, a pre-processor of CSS
- The result of this should be a food pyramid, with dynamics style when the mouse hovers the categories.
- Animation & Transitions incl. Scaling & Neon Lights.
- A non SCSS version is created incase the original version doesn't work.
